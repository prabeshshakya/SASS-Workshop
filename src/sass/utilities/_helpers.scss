// Helpers
// Helpers classes such as object classes used for floating an element left and right,
// text alignments etc. are included here.
// Simple helper classes are generally referred using class selectors and their css properties
// will have an !important property attached to it, so that a helper class cannot be overwritten.
// Placeholders can also be included in the helper partial for these purposes.
