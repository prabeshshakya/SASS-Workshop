# SASS-Workshop

First Install Node JS

Open command prompt/terminal in root folder.

Run 
<code>npm i</code>

By doing this all the dependencies should be installed.

Try running 
<code>gulp -v</code>
if it shows version then it's been installed.

if not run 
<code>npm i gulp -g</code>

It will install gulp globally and cmd/terminal will recognize the gulp command.

now run
<code>gulp watch</code>

Try changing some sass codes.
on every change it should compile code.

<h2>Happy Coding!!!</h2>
